            The international response to the Syrian Civil War has been polarized. Some media outlets tend towards a pro-regime bias, while others tend towards an anti-regime bias. Of interest is the difference in lexica between pro-regime media and anti-regime media. The task is to create a means of classifying an article on the Syrian Civil War as either pro-regime or anti-regime based on the lexicon used in the article. This entails creating a system that categorizes articles as pro-regime or anti-regime, and attempts to determine the respective lexica.

              The task is important as it can help determine the biases inherent in media coverage of the Syrian civil war by both pro- and anti-regime news sources. Media influence was a big factor in the Syrian civil war and is still very important to the ongoing war. It is hoped that this task can help determine which sides various media outlets took during the intial days and months of the Syrian civl war and whether there are specific sets of vocabulary used by pro- and anti-regime media. The successful creation of a classifier would allow a more detailed view of how widespread support for the regime or opposition is. Being able to answer questions such as "Does the British media support the Syrian government or opposition?" would allow a more detailed mapping of international opinion about the Syrian conflict and hopefully shed more light on the conflict.

            The solution was to test a set of different classifiers. Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, Multinomial Logistic Regression (Maximum Entropy), Decision Tree, and SVM methods were tested. Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Decision Tree methods from NLTK were used. The SVM method used was from the Sklearn package for Python. The Nearest Neighbor method was manually implemented. Nearest Neighbor was found to be unsuitable for the task, and was dropped. The remaining 4 methods were trained using unigram attributes, unigram attributes with stopwords removed, and bigram attributes.

            Our dataset is composed of news articles from a variety of news sources around the world. Each data entry is the text from a single news article. We wanted to get media coverage from as many countries as possible but due to the limited nature of google news source and our restriction of only being able to analyze english news articles we decided to settle on two US, two UK, two Chinese, and one Russian media outlet as the sources for our dataset. We chose these four countries in particular because we wanted to see if the biases of each countries' government were reflected in the countries' media. The American and British governments were some of the most vocal in speaking out against the Syrian regime while Russian was one of the most pro regime and the Chinese government was generally more neutral. We wanted to see if these same biases were apparent in the countries' biggest media outlets.

            We found our data by using the google news archive. We searched for articles related to the Syrian Civil War from the period Jan 1 2012 to December 31 2013. We used the Python Library BeautifulSoup to parse the actual text of each article.

            Accuracy was checked using the Repeated Random Sub-Sampling validation method. This consisted of selecting random subsets of the data to use for training, then using the remainder of the data for testing. An average over 10 trials was then used to determine accuracy. The training : testing data ratio ranged from 0.1:0.9 to 0.9:0.1, with nine different splits used in for each feature set and method.

            The most useful methods were Naive Bayes with a low number of training examples and SVM with a high number of training examples. Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree all outperformed ZeroR, with Maximum Entropy matching the performance of ZeroR. Bigrams did not provide an improvement in accuracy compared to unigrams. A variety of attributes were important to the task, including both vocabulary unrelated to the Syrian Civil War (such as "since," "particularly") and vocabulary relevant to the Syrian Civil War (such as "sarin," "militants," "the uprising").
